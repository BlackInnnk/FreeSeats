    <p><span class="title_content">DATASET <br/></span> This dataset captures real-time seat availability and occupancy levels from the official UCL API. The data reflects continuously updated information about free and occupied seating across Mashgate and One Pool Street.</p>

    <p><span class="title_content">DATA DEVICE (Physical)<br/></span> The physical data device presents real-time seat availability through a color-coded gauge, where each color represents a different level of occupancy. A servo-driven pointer moves dynamically according to the current availability rate, while simple descriptive labels provide an accessible interpretation of the data, such as indicating low, moderate, or high availability.</p>

    <p><span class="title_content">DATA DEVICE (Digital)<br/></span> The digital twin of the data device offers a richer and more interactive experience by displaying precise real-time seat availability along with in 30 mins' trends. Through the augmented interface, users can view dynamic line charts illustrating occupancy patterns across the 30mins, with the visualised data updating instantly based on the selected building.</p>
              <p><span class="title_content">HOW TO USE<br/></span> Open the App and point your camera at a flat surface to scan. The AR Dashboard and Gauge will automatically overlay on the surface, displaying real-time seat availability. Use the controls to toggle between One Pool Street and Marshgate, the dashboard will instantly display a breakdown of available seats for every floor in that building. The higher the percentage, the more seats are available. You can also drag the dashboard with your finger to reposition it.</p>
